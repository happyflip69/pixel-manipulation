# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

This repository contains a simple image encryption tool implemented using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool leverages basic XOR operations to encrypt and decrypt images. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates fundamental image processing and encryption concepts.

## Features

- **Encrypt Images**: Apply a basic XOR-based encryption to image pixels.
- **Decrypt Images**: Reverse the encryption to retrieve the original image.
- **Supports RGB and Grayscale Images**: Handles images in RGB and grayscale modes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL) library
- Numpy library

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
